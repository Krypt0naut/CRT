# CRT Monitor CSS Filter for Neocities

A lightweight and simple CRT filter, made specifically for Neocities sites. 

Inspired by this [pure CSS CRT filter](http://aleclownes.com/2017/02/01/crt-display.html) by Alec Lownes. Use his filter for a better experience, use mine if you don't want your RAM to cry every time you load your site.

>__To Install on your Neocites site:__

Just drop the PNG image ("pixel.png", required) and CSS file into the main directory of your site and make a DIV on your site like this: 

```<div id="crt"></div>``` .

__DOES NOT WORK IN INTERNET EXPLORER!__ IE doesn't play nice with opacity percentages.

/*  
    Simple CSS CRT filter by 𝕂𝕣𝕪𝕡𝕥𝕠𝕟𝕒𝕦𝕥 (et al). My eclectic site -> https://kry.pt 
    Inspired by this filter by Alec Lownes: http://aleclownes.com/2017/02/01/crt-display.html . 
    Hopefully less RAM-hogging for those (like me) who hear their laptop fans spin up every 
    time they open their sites on Chrome or Edge.

    Made with love for the Neocities community <3

    simply comment it out. Alec's version was a bit too overly complicated IMHO.

    Instead of pure CSS like Alec's, I used a small PNG of a collection of pixels 
    for the "screen door" effect. Results in happy RAM but requires, yaknow, the image.
    This sometimes results in the filter loading slowly but is nice for pixel font scaling.
